**C**reate React App with some extra (**R**edux/**A**xios/**S**aga/**S**CSS).

> Note: this project is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

Create React App has been amazing for quickly bootstrapping projects, but the packed-in libraries are intentionally limited. This repo is the standard stack that I've been using for personal and professional projects for the last 12 months. It's bound to evolve over time, but I intend on keeping _Create React App_ as a the foundation and taking it from there.  

## Extras:

- axios
- redux-saga
- redux-logger
- connected-react-router
- SCSS (now supported)
